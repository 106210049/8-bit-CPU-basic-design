# FIBONACI
# 1. Start with number 0 & 1
# 2. Add the 2 numbers and store the 2nd number & results into 2 addresses (out of the program)
# 3. Reload the stored 2 number out, repeat step 1
# End when the result is bigger than 8 bits
# The last values of the sequence should be in the 2 addresses

# Expected operation
# 0+1 = 1 -> store 1, 1
# load 1, 1
# 1+1 = 2 -> store 1, 2
# load 1, 2
# 1+2 = 3 -> store 2, 3
# load 2, 3
# repeat
